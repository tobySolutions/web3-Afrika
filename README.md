Welcome to my GitHub repo where I share my learnings from the 44-Day Hackathon by Web3 Afrika. As a participant in this hackathon, I gained valuable knowledge about web3 development and decentralized applications. Here are some of my key takeaways:

* Understanding blockchain technology is essential for web3 development.
* Solidity is a popular programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
* Tools like Truffle and Ganache are useful for testing and debugging smart contracts.
* The Web3.js library provides an easy way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from a web application.
* Designing user interfaces for decentralized applications requires a different approach than traditional web applications.

To help you get started with web3 development, here are some resources that I found useful:

* [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/) - The official website of the Ethereum blockchain provides a wealth of information about web3 development and smart contracts.
* [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) - The documentation for Solidity, the most popular programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
* [Truffle Documentation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) - The documentation for Truffle, a popular development framework for Ethereum.
* [Web3.js Documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/) - The documentation for Web3.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
* [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) - An interactive tutorial for learning Solidity through building a zombie game on the Ethereum blockchain.

I hope these resources help you get started with web3 development. Feel free to explore my repo to learn more about my experience in the 44-Day Hackathon by Web3 Afrika.

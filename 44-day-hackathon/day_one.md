# Day 1: Blockchain Introduction and Conceptualization

## Content

- Review of Blockchain Technology
- Blockchain Primitives


### Contextualizing Blockchain:

Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records called BLOCKS. The blockchain is sort of a public database. It is a connection
of several of those BLOCKS in a CHAIN in a peer-to-peer manner. The Blockchain as a LEDGER (cos it contains records), requires every transaction to be signed by the
author of the transaction.


## Distributed Ledger:

In contrast to a Centralized ledger, the Disrtibuted Ledger is such that the transactions for each node (person) in the ledger is updated realtime, because everyone 
in the network shares the same ledger/records.


## Differences between DLT (Distributed LEDGER Technology) and Blockchain:

- The Blockchain is just one type of DLT
- There is no middle-man in the DL.
- All Blockchains are DLTs, not all DLs are BLOCKCHAINS
- The DL does not necessarily use Blocks to represent their ledgers.



N.b: Cryptocurrency is like a proof-of-work.
N.b: Miners help get the transactions from clients into blocks that can then be put into a chain.


## Consensus Mechanisms:

- Consensus mechanisms: Facilitate agreement among participants of a DDS (Distributed data system) to guarantee data consistency
- Consensus Algorithm: achieve reliability and establish trust among unknown peers in the network
- Consensus protocol: Every new block added to the blockchain is the one and only version of the truth that is agreed upon by everyone in the blockchain. Just to incentivise honesty in the blockchain

### Consensus Mechanisms:

- Proof of work
- Proof of stake
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): MAJORITY OF WINS! 
- Proof of Authority
- Proof of Capacity
- Proof Of Activity
- Proof of Importance
- Delegated proof of stake
